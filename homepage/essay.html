                They were born in a small Indian valley in 2030 BC. Over the centuries, they endured harsh winters in countless homes, hoarded like treasure during Columbus’s voyages, and finally, during the Age of Exploration, ventured their way to American soil. Pickles—crafted from humble beginnings—have journeyed across continents and cultures, weaving into the fabric of history. Today, in the heart of New York City, they stand as enduring emblems of identity, history, and survival.

                As waves of immigrants arrived in New York, they brought the rich traditions of their homeland, transforming the gentrified streets into symbols of identity and culture. From the sharp tang of Kosher Dill pickles at a corner deli, to the endless jars of kimchi in a bustling Korean restaurant and pickled garlic in Chinatown’s groceries, pickles stand as cultural cornerstones in the heart of New York City. The diversity of pickling serves as both cultural preservation and a resilient shield against the wave of gentrification in New York City.

                Take, for example, the Korean mothers with their stuffed kimchi jars in every corner of H-Mart in K-town, brimming from aisle to aisle. Along with the shin ramen instant noodles and trendy K-beauty products, they stand as an indomitable presence, an enriching, pungent scent tinged with a piece of home. Through New York’s bristling winters and sweltering summers, these mothers continue a centuries-old tradition of fermenting cabbage with chili paste, garlic, and ginger. With every press of cabbage to the bottom of the container, they push back against a city quick to discard old traditions. The sharp smell is a reminder that this space, culture, and heritage aren’t so easily erased. Though the city is changing, the roots of kimchi and its culture remain. Korean mothers continue their steadfast rituals, filling jars with history and love, and planting seeds in New York City's heart.

                Similarly, in Chinatown, Chinese grandmothers are the jars of pickled garlic quietly resting in the corner of the kitchen. They walk through the streets as new aesthetic cafes and minimalist shops replace local storefronts, fish markets, and neon-lit shops. Unfazed by the pressures to conform, they clutch their worn GNA shopping trolleys, reaching deep into their coin-filled pockets for the price of their identity. From their first step on American soil at forty, to caring for their American-born grandchildren at seventy, they continue peeling, brining, and fermenting garlic just as they always have. Even as the world outside threatens to bury their culture under New York City's new, trendy, American flavors. Chinese grandmas preserve the essence of a disappearing past, nurturing the heart of the city under their care. Each jar becomes a quiet rebellion—a survival ritual.

                I walk through Ktown, nestled in a hub of Korean culture, where crowds gather under glowing awnings to savor sizzling Korean barbeque and steaming bowls of kimchi jjigae. I walk through Downtown Chinatown, where the aroma of $5-for-15 dumplings mingles with the lively sounds of canal street vendors advertising their fresh fruit. I walk to the heart of New York City, where amidst the skyscrapers, chaos, and colliding cultures, there lies a pickle. In these walks, I start to wonder: what happens when the flavor thins out, and the spice turns unfamiliar? When culture, once rich and vibrant, is served as an accessory, stripped of its soul? I began to realize that this is impossible—because I’m here. We’re still here. In the face of gentrification, where cultures are reshaped and neighborhoods disappear, I recognize that the essence of a place can’t be erased. If you stay in a pickle city long enough, you absorb its essence: We become a part of the spice, tradition, and culture they bring from around the world to the very heart of New York City.

                I am a mix of pickled cucumber, garlic, kimchi, and every pickle in between. I am the product of those who came before me and kept what mattered while the city evolved. We are history. And so, we are pickles.
